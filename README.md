# Node-Link-Graph-Visualization
How to make graphs easier to understand, by creating a circle link graph and line link graph.

To make the graph clear we have implemented an algorithm, The purpose of this algorithm is to build an arcs diagram from a graph G of N nodes. An arcs diagram consists of placing the nodes (v0, v1, v2, ..., vN-1) of G on an axis and replace each edge with an arc joining them as shown in Figure below.

If the distance between two connected nodes increases, the arcs will be away from the axis, which increases the viewing space. The goal is to find the best placement of the nodes on the axis which reduces the lengths of the arcs to draw.
